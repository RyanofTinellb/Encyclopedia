                "Within the universe named Tinellb, there is a planet named Ptoko&middot; There arose on this world a race of humanoids, the Ptokan&middot; Over millions of years, their race evolved and became the dominant force on their planet&middot;\nThere had been many conflicts, small and large, throughout their history&middot; One particularly bloody war had had much of the population brought into it: a World War&middot; The survivors of this war were ruled by a single monarch&middot;\nGenerations passed&middot; The people rebuilt their shattered world&middot; The newest ruler, Queen Loren, decided to create an international language to promote peace amongst her subjects&middot; She named this language Lulani after herself&middot;\nDespite their shared language, as more time went by, fractures again showed between nations&middot; Another world war ensued&middot; A great weapon was created, one that tore apart space&#x2011;time, flinging its victims far out into the universe&middot;\nOne such group were the Fezhle&middot; They found themselves on an empty world&middot; The Fezhle tongue evolved independently from Lulani, and was later heavily influenced by Zhaladi dialects&middot;\nThe people that remained on Ptoko slowly grew back towards peace&middot; Their vernacular evolved into Ptokan, and thence into Brequen&middot; By this time, Lulani was used only for science and the arts, not for everyday use&middot;\nBrequen was spoken in the realm of Breque, Tsarin in Tsarein&middot;\n",
